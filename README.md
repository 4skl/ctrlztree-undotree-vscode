# CtrlZTree - Visual Undo History for VS Code

CtrlZTree brings tree-based undo/redo functionality to VS Code, inspired by the [undotree for Vim](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree). Unlike traditional linear undo/redo that loses alternative edit paths, CtrlZTree preserves all your editing history in a branching tree structure.

## ‚ú® Features

### üå≥ Tree-Based History
- **Branching History**: Never lose edit alternatives when you undo and make new changes
- **Visual Tree View**: See your entire editing history as an interactive graph
- **Smart Navigation**: Click any node to instantly jump to that state

### üéØ Enhanced Undo/Redo
- **Custom Undo/Redo**: Replaces VS Code's default Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y with tree-aware operations
- **Alternative Keybinding**: Ctrl+Shift+Z (Cmd+Shift+Z on Mac) also works for redo operations
- **Smart Empty File Undo**: When file is empty and you press Ctrl+Z, automatically jumps to the latest non-empty state
- **Branch Selection**: When multiple redo paths exist, choose which branch to follow
- **Content Preview**: See previews of document states when selecting branches

### üìä Interactive Visualization
- **Real-time Updates**: Tree view updates automatically as you edit
- **Dynamic Editor Switching**: Tree view automatically adapts when switching between different editor tabs/files
- **File-specific Trees**: Each open file maintains its own history tree
- **Seamless Multi-Document Support**: Single panel intelligently shows the history for whichever file is currently active
- **Visual Indicators**: Current position highlighted in red, other states in blue
- **Enhanced Tooltips**: Hover over nodes to see concise diff previews showing only changed lines
- **Smart Content Display**: Tooltips show git-style diffs with intelligent truncation for large changes

## üöÄ How It Works

### Automatic History Tracking
CtrlZTree automatically tracks every change you make to your files, building a tree structure where:
- Each **node** represents a unique document state
- Each **edge** connects a parent state to a child state  
- **Branches** form when you undo and then make different changes

### Smart Diff Storage
Instead of storing complete document copies, CtrlZTree uses intelligent diff algorithms:
- Only stores the differences between document states
- Uses SHA-256 hashing to identify identical states
- Applies diffs efficiently to reconstruct any historical state

### Tree Navigation
- **Linear Undo/Redo**: When there's only one path, behaves like normal undo/redo
- **Branch Selection**: When multiple paths exist, shows a picker with content previews
- **Visual Navigation**: Click any node in the tree view to jump directly to that state

## üéÆ Usage

### Commands
- **CtrlZTree: Undo** - Navigate to parent node in history tree
- **CtrlZTree: Redo** - Navigate to child node (with branch selection if multiple paths)
- **CtrlZTree: Visualize History Tree** - Open interactive tree visualization

### Default Keybindings
- `Ctrl+Z` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Z` (Mac) - CtrlZTree Undo
- `Ctrl+Y` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Y` (Mac) - CtrlZTree Redo
- `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Shift+Z` (Mac) - CtrlZTree Redo (Alternative)

### Visualization Panel
1. Run the **"CtrlZTree: Visualize History Tree"** command
2. A new panel opens showing your edit history as an interactive graph
3. **Dynamic Updates**: Panel automatically switches to show the history tree of whichever file you're currently editing
4. **Current state** is prominently displayed at the top level with enhanced styling (larger, bold text and thicker border)
5. **Other states** appear in blue with standard styling
6. **Click any node** to instantly navigate to that document state
7. **Hover over nodes** to see enhanced tooltips with concise change previews
8. **Panel title** updates automatically to show "CtrlZTree \<filename\>" for the active file
9. **Seamless switching**: Move between different files and the tree view follows automatically

### Enhanced Tooltips (v0.2.0)
- **Git-style Diffs**: Tooltips show only the actual changed lines (+ and - lines)
- **Clean Display**: No redundant headers or duplicate text - just the essential changes
- **Smart Truncation**: Large diffs are limited to 15 lines with a "more changes" indicator
- **Better Readability**: Improved formatting for quick understanding of what changed

## üí° Example Workflow

1. **Start editing** a file - CtrlZTree begins tracking changes
2. **Make some changes** (A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C)
3. **Undo twice** to return to state A
4. **Make different changes** (A ‚Üí D ‚Üí E)
5. **Open visualization** to see your branching history:
   ```
   A
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ B ‚Üí C
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ D ‚Üí E (current)
   ```
6. **Click node C** to instantly return to that state
7. **Continue editing** to extend any branch

## üîß Requirements

- VS Code 1.60.0 or higher
- No additional dependencies required

## ‚öôÔ∏è Extension Settings

Currently, CtrlZTree works out of the box with no configuration required. The extension:
- Automatically activates when VS Code starts
- Replaces default undo/redo keybindings when editing text
- Creates separate history trees for each file

## üêõ Known Issues

- **History Persistence**: History trees are currently lost when VS Code is restarted or files are closed and reopened
- **Large Files**: Performance may be impacted on very large files due to diff calculations
- **Memory Usage**: Long editing sessions may accumulate significant history data

## üìã Planned Features

- [ ] **Persistent History**: Save history trees to disk for persistence across sessions
- [ ] **History Cleanup**: Automatic pruning of old/unused branches
- [ ] **Export/Import**: Save and restore specific history states
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Better handling of large files and extensive histories
- [ ] **Search**: Find specific changes or content in history
- [ ] **Branch Naming**: Add custom labels to important history points
