# CtrlZTree - Visual Undo History for VS Code

CtrlZTree brings tree-based undo/redo functionality to VS Code, inspired by the [undotree for Vim](https://github.com/mbbill/undotree). Unlike traditional linear undo/redo that loses alternative edit paths, CtrlZTree preserves all your editing history in a branching tree structure.

## ✨ Features

### 🌳 Tree-Based History
- **Branching History**: Never lose edit alternatives when you undo and make new changes
- **Visual Tree View**: See your entire editing history as an interactive graph
- **Smart Navigation**: Click any node to instantly jump to that state

### 🎯 Enhanced Undo/Redo
- **Custom Undo/Redo**: Replaces VS Code's default Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+Y with tree-aware operations
- **Alternative Keybinding**: Ctrl+Shift+Z (Cmd+Shift+Z on Mac) also works for redo operations
- **Smart Empty File Undo**: When file is empty and you press Ctrl+Z, automatically jumps to the latest non-empty state
- **Branch Selection**: When multiple redo paths exist, choose which branch to follow
- **Content Preview**: See previews of document states when selecting branches

### 📊 Interactive Visualization
- **Real-time Updates**: Tree view updates automatically as you edit
- **Dynamic Editor Switching**: Tree view automatically adapts when switching between different editor tabs/files
- **File-specific Trees**: Each open file maintains its own history tree
- **Seamless Multi-Document Support**: Single panel intelligently shows the history for whichever file is currently active
- **Visual Indicators**: Current position highlighted in red, other states in blue
- **Enhanced Tooltips**: Hover over nodes to see concise diff previews showing only changed lines
- **Smart Content Display**: Tooltips show git-style diffs with intelligent truncation for large changes
- **Integrated Action Buttons**: Select any node to reveal action buttons below it, including "📊 View Diff" for nodes with parents
- **Read-Only Document Handling**: Diff views and other read-only documents don't interfere with tree tracking

## 🚀 How It Works

### Automatic History Tracking
CtrlZTree automatically tracks every change you make to your files, building a tree structure where:
- Each **node** represents a unique document state
- Each **edge** connects a parent state to a child state  
- **Branches** form when you undo and then make different changes

### Smart Diff Storage
Instead of storing complete document copies, CtrlZTree uses intelligent diff algorithms:
- Only stores the differences between document states
- Uses SHA-256 hashing to identify identical states
- Applies diffs efficiently to reconstruct any historical state

### Tree Navigation
- **Linear Undo/Redo**: When there's only one path, behaves like normal undo/redo
- **Branch Selection**: When multiple paths exist, shows a picker with content previews
- **Visual Navigation**: Click any node in the tree view to jump directly to that state
- **Diff Comparison**: Select a node to reveal the "📊 View Diff" button, then click it to view changes from parent in a separate column

## 🎮 Usage

### Commands
- **CtrlZTree: Undo** - Navigate to parent node in history tree
- **CtrlZTree: Redo** - Navigate to child node (with branch selection if multiple paths)
- **CtrlZTree: Visualize History Tree** - Open interactive tree visualization

### Default Keybindings
- `Ctrl+Z` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Z` (Mac) - CtrlZTree Undo
- `Ctrl+Y` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Y` (Mac) - CtrlZTree Redo
- `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (Windows/Linux) / `Cmd+Shift+Z` (Mac) - CtrlZTree Redo (Alternative)

### Visualization Panel
1. Run the **"CtrlZTree: Visualize History Tree"** command
2. A new panel opens showing your edit history as an interactive graph
3. **Dynamic Updates**: Panel automatically switches to show the history tree of whichever file you're currently editing
4. **Current state** is prominently displayed at the top level with enhanced styling (larger, bold text and thicker border)
5. **Other states** appear in blue with standard styling
6. **Click any node** to select it and navigate to that document state
7. **Action buttons** appear below the selected node (for nodes with parents)
8. **Click "📊 View Diff"** to open a side-by-side diff view showing changes from parent (opens beside the graph)
9. **Hover for tooltips** to see enhanced previews with concise change summaries
10. **Panel title** updates automatically to show "CtrlZTree \<filename\>" for the active file
11. **Seamless switching**: Move between different files and the tree view follows automatically
12. **Read-only handling**: When viewing diff or other read-only documents, tree shows last valid editor's history

### Enhanced Tooltips (v0.2.0)
- **Git-style Diffs**: Tooltips show only the actual changed lines (+ and - lines)
- **Clean Display**: No redundant headers or duplicate text - just the essential changes
- **Smart Truncation**: Large diffs are limited to 15 lines with a "more changes" indicator
- **Better Readability**: Improved formatting for quick understanding of what changed

## 💡 Example Workflow

1. **Start editing** a file - CtrlZTree begins tracking changes
2. **Make some changes** (A → B → C)
3. **Undo twice** to return to state A
4. **Make different changes** (A → D → E)
5. **Open visualization** to see your branching history:
   ```
   A
   ├── B → C
   └── D → E (current)
   ```
6. **Click node C** to select it and navigate to that state
7. **"📊 View Diff" button** appears below node C
8. **Click the diff button** to see what changed from B to C in a side-by-side diff view (opens beside the tree)
9. **Continue editing** to extend any branch

## 🔧 Requirements

- VS Code 1.60.0 or higher
- No additional dependencies required

## ⚙️ Extension Settings

Currently, CtrlZTree works out of the box with no configuration required. The extension:
- Automatically activates when VS Code starts
- Replaces default undo/redo keybindings when editing text
- Creates separate history trees for each file
- Only tracks editable files (ignores read-only files, diff views, and special VS Code documents)

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **History Persistence**: History trees are currently lost when VS Code is restarted or files are closed and reopened
- **Large Files**: Performance may be impacted on very large files due to diff calculations
- **Memory Usage**: Long editing sessions may accumulate significant history data

## 📋 Planned Features

- [ ] **Persistent History**: Save history trees to disk for persistence across sessions
- [ ] **History Cleanup**: Automatic pruning of old/unused branches
- [ ] **Export/Import**: Save and restore specific history states
- [ ] **Performance Optimization**: Better handling of large files and extensive histories
- [ ] **Search**: Find specific changes or content in history
- [ ] **Branch Naming**: Add custom labels to important history points
